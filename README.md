# Introduction
Skvader is Roguelike ,  ASCII,  dungeon crawler created for [Itch.io's Game Off 2018](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018).

In Skvader you play the role of a keen chef who has landed an opportunity to study under the greatest chef in the world Francisco Cuisinier in the world-renowned restaurant l' alimentation. However, the restaurant isn't quite what it seems...

As you settle in to your new job and run errands for your new boss, you discover that the ancient building contains many corridors and more rooms than you would expect from looking at it from the outside.

In Skvader, as you search the depths of  l' alimentation for the ingredients and equipment necessary to survive another evening's service in the restaurant, and improve as a chef, you are faced with difficult decisions - the consequences of which don't always result in a net-positive... 

## Game Off Theme
The theme for this year's Game Off was HYBRID! In which we were able to interpret that theme in any way that we wished.

One of the suggestions of libraries/tools for those that were new to game development (such as myself) was to use [Ondras' rot-js](https://github.com/ondras/rot.js) ROguelike Toolkit.

Since I was going to be using this library and building a Roguelike game, I knew that I had to incorporate dungeon crawling into the game somehow. As someone that both enjoys eating in restaurants and cooking, I decided to to make the game a hybrid of a culinary themed dungeon crawler.

I was also keen for the game to have some depth around the hybrid theme and I found the perfect way to add this when looking for a name for the project. [Skvader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skvader) is "a Swedish fictional creature that... has the forequarters and hindlegs of a European hare (Lepus europaeus), and the back, wings and tail of a female wood grouse" - a fictional hybrid creature. Also, "The term 'skvader' is nowadays used colloquially in Swedish to mean 'a bad compromise' or 'a combination of contradicting elements'". I incorporated this theme of bad compromises into the game too. 

# Playing the Game


# Running the project locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

*Note: currently there are not proper tests for this project*

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
